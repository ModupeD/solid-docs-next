<Title>Deploying to AWS via Flightcontrol</Title>

Here we're going to use [Flightcontrol](https://www.flightcontrol.dev/?ref=solid) to deploy our Solid project.

If you haven't heard of Flightcontrol, it's a platform that fully automates deployments to Amazon Web Services (AWS). For more information on Flightcontrol and what they offer, visit [flightcontrol.dev](https://www.flightcontrol.dev/?ref=solid).

## Connecting Flightcontrol with Your Online Git Repository

With Flightcontrol you can make use of GitHub's continuous development actions. When connecting Flightcontrol with your GitHub repo there's no further configuration that needs to be done in order to host and update the site on Flightcontrol.

Flightcontrol automatically detects pushes to the branch specified and builds the project based on the commands specified in the `package.json` and the settings in the Flightcontrol build settings.

Here's a quick step by step guide to get your Solid online repo code up and running on Flightcontrol.

**Step 1:** Log into or sign up on Flightcontrol.

**Step 2:** Connect your Github account to Flightcontrol.

## Option 1: Using Dashboard

**Step 1:** Create a Flightcontrol project from the Dashboard. Select a repository for the source.

**Step 2:** Select the GUI Config Type.

**Step 3:** Add a static site service by clicking the `Add a Static Site` option.

**Step 4:** Add an output directory, `dist`.

**Step 5:** Add any environment variables your project might need.

**Step 6:** Submit the new project form.

## Option 2: Using Code

Use the flightcontrol.json configuration for the project

**Step 1:** Create a Flightcontrol project from your dashboard. Select a repository for the source.

**Step 2:** Select the flightcontrol.json Config Type.

**Step 3:** Add a new file at the root of your repository called `flightcontrol.json`. Here's an example configuration that creates a static site service for your Solid app:

```json filename="flightcontrol.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://app.flightcontrol.dev/schema.json",
  "environments": [
    {
      "id": "production",
      "name": "Production",
      "region": "us-west-2",
      "source": {
        "branch": "main"
      },
      "services": [
        {
          "id": "my-static-solid",
          "buildType": "nixpacks",
          "name": "My static solid site",
          "type": "static",
          "domain": "solid.yourapp.com",
          "outputDirectory": "dist",
          "singlePageApp": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
